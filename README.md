# Stroke_Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict stroke risk based on health and demographic data. Key steps included KNN imputation, label encoding, MinMax scaling, and SMOTE for class imbalance. An optimized XGBoost model achieved strong performance, highlighting age, glucose level, and hypertension as key predictors.
