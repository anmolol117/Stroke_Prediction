# Stroke_Prediction
Stroke remains one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term disability across the globe. Its sudden onset and potentially devastating effects make early detection and intervention crucial. This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict the likelihood of stroke in individuals based on a diverse set of health and demographic features. A real-world healthcare dataset containing information such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, glucose levels, and smoking status was used for model development.
Comprehensive data preprocessing steps were implemented to ensure data quality and consistency. This included handling missing values using KNN imputation for the bmi feature, encoding categorical variables through label encoding, and scaling numerical features using MinMaxScaler for better model convergence. A significant challenge addressed in this project was the extreme class imbalanceâ€”very few positive stroke cases compared to non-stroke cases. To resolve this, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) was applied, improving the model's sensitivity toward minority class prediction.
The XGBoost algorithm, known for its high performance and robustness, was selected as the classification model. Initially, a baseline XGBoost model was trained, followed by hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search with cross-validation to enhance its predictive power. The optimized model was then retrained on the resampled and preprocessed data and evaluated using accuracy, classification report, ROC-AUC score, and a confusion matrix.
Results showed that the final model performed well in distinguishing between stroke and non-stroke cases, with important features such as glucose level, age, and hypertension contributing significantly to predictions. Visualizations such as feature importance plots and confusion matrices were included to interpret the model further. This project demonstrates the feasibility and impact of integrating machine learning into healthcare workflows to enable proactive risk assessment and timely medical intervention.
